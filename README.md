# Project-Overactive-Mind
Where crazy off cuff ideas are tested

RESEARCH IDEA (OF SORTS):
approach to artificial intelligence centered on building hierarchical, modular neural networks capable of self-supervised meta-learning, methodology leverages modularity to create specialized sub-networks that can be trained on specific tasks or domains.
integrating self-supervised learning techniques and meta-learning strategies, the AI system can adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training.
